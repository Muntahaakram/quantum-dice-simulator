# Quantum Dice Simulator

This project simulates rolling a six-sided dice using quantum randomness generated by IBM's Qiskit framework.

## Overview

Traditional random number generators use classical algorithms, but quantum computers provide true randomness by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. This project uses a quantum circuit with Hadamard gates to create superposition states and measures qubits to generate random dice rolls.

## Features

- Quantum circuit for generating random dice rolls (1 to 6)
- Visualization of dice faces using Matplotlib and Pillow
- Creates an animated GIF showing multiple dice rolls
- Educational demonstration of quantum randomness and measurement

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably 3.7+).  
Then install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-ibm-runtime matplotlib pillow
